## About

This repository provides a sample FastAPI application along with scripts and configurations to facilitate deployment. The goal is to make it easy to get started with FastAPI and to deploy it using modern DevOps practices.

## Features

- 🚀 FastAPI application setup
- 🐳 Docker integration for containerization
- 🧪 Environment-based configuration
- ♻️ Production-ready deployment examples
- 📦 Dependency management with `requirements.txt`
- 📄 Example usage and endpoints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshu0508Raturi/FastAPI-deployment.git
   cd FastAPI-deployment
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Locally

Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Access the interactive docs at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## Deployment

This repo includes configurations for deploying with Docker or directly to popular cloud providers.

### Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t fastapi-deployment .
   ```
2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-deployment
   ```

### Production Deployment

- For production, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers.
- Use environment variables to manage secrets and settings.
- Deploy using CI/CD workflows (example: GitHub Actions).
